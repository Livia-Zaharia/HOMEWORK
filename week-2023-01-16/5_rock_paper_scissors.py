# 5. Rock, paper, scissors2
# : Rock, paper, scissors is a popular hand game for two players. The
# two players simultaneously choose one of the three possible moves and determine the
# winner of the game: rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, and scissors beats paper.
# This exercise involves determining a gameâ€™s outcome given the moves of the two players.
# Write a program that takes in the inputs for both players and then displays the winner
# out of the two or tie if that is the case. Handle the situations when the input
# is neither rock, paper or scissors and display a message that the game cannot 
# go on until a right option is chosen.

#8. Roulette Payouts: A roulette wheel has 38 spaces on it. Of these spaces, 18 are black, 18 are
#red, and two are green. The green spaces are numbered 0 and 00. The red spaces are
#numbered 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 30 32, 34 and 36. The remaining
#integers between 1 and 36 are used to number the black spaces. Many different bets can be
#placed in roulette. We will only consider the following subset of them in this exercise:
#1. Single number (1 to 36, 0, or 00)
#2. Red versus Black
#3. Odd versus Even (Note that 0 and 00 do not pay out for even)
#4. 1 to 18 versus 19 to 36
#Write a program that simulates a spin of a roulette wheel by using Pythonâ€™s random number
#generator or read it from the user. Display the number that was selected and all of the bets
#that must be payed. For example, if 13 is selected then your program should display:
#The spin resulted in 13...
#Pay 13
#Pay Black
#Pay Odd
#Pay 1 to 18
#If the simulation results in 0 or 00 then your program should display Pay 0 or Pay 00 without
#any further output

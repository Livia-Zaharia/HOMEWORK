2. The Twelve Days of Christmas1
: The Twelve Days of Christmas is a repetitive song that
describes an increasingly long list of gifts sent to oneâ€™s true love on each of 12 days. A single
gift is sent on the first day. A new gift is added to the collection on each additional day, and
then the complete collection is sent. The first three verses of the song are shown below. The
complete lyrics are available on the internet.
On the first day of Christmas
my true love sent to me:
A partridge in a pear tree.
On the second day of Christmas
my true love sent to me:
Two turtle doves,
And a partridge in a pear tree.
On the third day of Christmas
my true love sent to me:
Three French hens,
Two turtle doves,
And a partridge in a pear tree

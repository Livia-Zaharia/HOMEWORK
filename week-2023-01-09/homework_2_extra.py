#1. Dog Years: It is commonly said that one human year is equivalent to 7 dog years. However
#this simple conversion fails to recognize that dogs reach adulthood in approximately two
#years. As a result, some people believe that it is better to count each of the first two human
#years as 10.5 dog years, and then count each additional human year as 4 dog years. Write a
#program that implements the conversion from human years to dog years described in the
#previous paragraph. Ensure that your program works correctly for conversions of less than
#two human years and for conversions of two or more human years. Your program should
#display an appropriate error message if the user enters a negative number.

#2. Sound Levels: The following table lists the sound level in decibels for several common
#noises.
#Write a program that reads a sound level in decibels from the user. If the user enters a decibel
#level that matches one of the noises in the table then your program should display a message
#containing only that noise. If the user enters a number of decibels between the noises listed then
#your program should display a message indicating which noises the level is between. Ensure that
#your program also generates reasonable output for a value smaller than the quietest noise in the
#table, and for a value larger than the loudest noise in the table.

#3. What Color is that Square?: Positions on a chess board are identified by a letter and a
#number. The letter identifies the column, while the number identifies the row, as shown
#below:
#Write a program that reads a position from the user. Use an if statement to determine if the
#column begins with a black square or a white square. Then use modular arithmetic to report the
#color of the square in that row. For example, if the user enters a1 then your program should
#report that the square is black. If the user enters d5 then your program should report that the
#square is white. Your program may assume that a valid position will always be entered. It does
#not need to perform any error checking.

#4. Chinese Zodiac: The Chinese zodiac assigns animals to years in a 12 year cycle. One 12 year
#cycle is shown in the table below. The pattern repeats from there, with 2012 being another
#year of the dragon, and 1999 being another year of the hare.
#Write a program that reads a year from the user and displays the animal associated with that
#year. Your program should work correctly for any year greater than or equal to zero, not just the
#ones listed in the table.

#5. Letter Grade to Grade Points: At a particular university, letter grades are mapped to grade
#points in the following manner:
#Write a program that begins by reading a letter grade from the user. Then your program should
#compute and display the equivalent number of grade points. Ensure that your program generates
#an appropriate error message if the user enters an invalid letter grade.

try:
    print("that means "+ str(grades_number[grades_letters.index(letter_grade)])+" in points")
except ValueError:

#6. Grade Points to Letter Grade: In the previous exercise you created a program that converts
#a letter grade into the equivalent number of grade points. In this exercise you will create a
#program that reverses the process and converts from a grade point value entered by the
#user to a letter grade. Ensure that your program handles grade point values that fall between
#letter grades. These should be rounded to the closest letter grade. Your program should
#report A+ for a 4.0 (or greater) grade point average.

#7. Cell Phone Bill: A particular cell phone plan includes 50 minutes of air time and 50 text
#messages for $15.00 a month. Each additional minute of air time costs $0.25, while
#additional text messages cost $0.15 each. All cell phone bills include an additional charge of
#$0.44 to support 911 call centers, and the entire bill (including the 911 charge) is subject to 5
#percent sales tax. Write a program that reads the number of minutes and text messages
#used in a month from the user. Display the base charge, additional minutes charge (if any),
#additional text message charge (if any), the 911 fee, tax and total bill amount. Only display

#8. Roulette Payouts: A roulette wheel has 38 spaces on it. Of these spaces, 18 are black, 18 are
#red, and two are green. The green spaces are numbered 0 and 00. The red spaces are
#numbered 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 30 32, 34 and 36. The remaining
#integers between 1 and 36 are used to number the black spaces. Many different bets can be
#placed in roulette. We will only consider the following subset of them in this exercise:
#1. Single number (1 to 36, 0, or 00)
#2. Red versus Black
#3. Odd versus Even (Note that 0 and 00 do not pay out for even)
#4. 1 to 18 versus 19 to 36
#Write a program that simulates a spin of a roulette wheel by using Pythonâ€™s random number
#generator or read it from the user. Display the number that was selected and all of the bets
#that must be payed. For example, if 13 is selected then your program should display:
#The spin resulted in 13...
#Pay 13
#Pay Black
#Pay Odd
#Pay 1 to 18
#If the simulation results in 0 or 00 then your program should display Pay 0 or Pay 00 without
#any further outp
